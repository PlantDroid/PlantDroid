## Project Abstract
In recent years, with the gradual increase of urban greening, more and more people want to know about the surrounding plants and classify and collect them. However, the current plant recognition software can not meet the growing demand for knowledge, PlantDroid came being, it can not only meet the needs of users to query but also through collection and map functions to stimulate users, expanding the audience of plant recognition software.

## Environment Setup
Our app is stable on Android versions 10 and 11 and can be adapted to most mobile and tablet models. Our development is done on the virtual machine Pixel4 (API30, 1080Ã—2280: 440dpi) and we can guarantee the wendi of the app on this model.

Thank you to all five team members for your outstanding contributions.
